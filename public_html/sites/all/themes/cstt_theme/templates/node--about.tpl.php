    <h3 style="position:relative;clear:both;">Project Summary</h3>

    <p style="position:relative;clear:both;">
      <strong>Problem:</strong> CS pedagogical content knowledge (CS PCK) – i.e., knowledge of how to teach computer science – is mostly undocumented.
      <br>
      <strong>Project Goal:</strong> Develop a set of CS teaching tips to help novice teachers anticipate students’ difficulties and build upon students’ strengths.
      <br>
      <strong>Status:</strong> Beginning the project in October of 2013, we are currently recruiting CS teachers who have insights into student learning.
